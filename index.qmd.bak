      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am an econometrician with experience in applied macroeconomics, forecasting, and credit risk. I currently work at Lloyds Banking Group within the commercial banking stress-testing framework, leading Credit Cycle Index models and corporate insolvencies work. I build econometric models and automate model pipelines in R (R Markdown, R Shiny), and Iâ€™m experienced in producing economic outlook reports and regular commentary on the UK economy and data releases. I spend my spare time reading and analysing macro developments, and occasionally write about economic policy and financial markets.</p>
