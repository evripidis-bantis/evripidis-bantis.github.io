    "section": "",
    "text": "The euro, despite structural weaknesses (incomplete banking union, fragmented capital markets), retains important institutional strengths. These include the ECBâ€™s independence, legal constraints on fiscal dominance, and a rules-based framework that can insulate policy from short-term political cycles.\nIn an era of greater political intervention in monetary policy, these features can be a strategic advantage for the euro relative to the dollar."
