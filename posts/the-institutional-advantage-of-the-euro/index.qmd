The euro, despite structural weaknesses (incomplete banking union, fragmented capital markets),
retains important institutional strengths. These include the ECBâ€™s independence, legal
constraints on fiscal dominance, and a rules-based framework that can insulate policy from
short-term political cycles.

In an era of greater political intervention in monetary policy, these features can be a
strategic advantage for the euro relative to the dollar.
